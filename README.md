I decided to start the path of becoming a full stack developer on Monday 8th January 2024.

Web designing and developing was something I always wanted to learn, so I decided to go for it full time.

This very special project was done during mid January, just after I finished learning about HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript. 

This project helped me to learn how to code HTML and CSS, how to write some vanilla Javascript for interacting with the DOM and how to make a Responsive webpage.

The idea of this project was to create a site for a future furniture restoration shop for my girlfriend, who likes to restore old furniture. I will for sure come back to this project in the future and update it to make it a full stack webpage.
